    "body": "<p>Frameworks used: UIKit, EventKit</p><p>Contributions: Team lead, worked on all parts of the project.</p><p>My Novel Write Now's main purpose is to provide an interface for writers, or anyone working on a writing project, to track their progress. Many writing projects (or competitions, such as National Novel Writing Month) have a minimum word count goal and a deadline. My Novel Write Now allows the user to create a project that takes this information as input, allows the user to record their daily wordcount, and track their overall progress. My Novel Write Now can also save a project's deadline into the user's calendar (via the Calendar App) so that they are reminded of upcoming due dates. I worked on this project with <a href='https://github.com/coreymalek'>Corey Malek</a>.</p>"

So, you'll also need to keep track of how many times each image is displayed and do the calculations.</p><p>&#8220;You are also responsible for the look and feel of the app, so don't forget a custom font, color palette, layout with semantic HTML, and so on.&#8221;</p>"
